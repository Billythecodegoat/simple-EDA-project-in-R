# simple-EDA-project-in-R
this is a simple eda project on a large data set in R, for demonstrative purposes

In this project, hypothetical delivery data is analyzed to draw conclusions from which decions can be based on.
In this scenario, a food and drink delivery company compares the age and speed of delivery men to see if older delivery persons take longer to deliver than younger ones. This information could be used to affect the employment criteria for delivery persons, for example. A second investigation is taken to see if there is a relationship between the speed of a delivery person and the rating that delivery person gets. This would help the company decide whether the first investigation results should affect the employment criteria in the first place. 
The first section of the data is focused on engineering the data into data more suited for the results we are interested in. 
Different scatter plots made using the ggplot() function are included to give visuals that would help us understand relationships. Furthermore, statistical tests are used to find the significance of the relationships the scatter plots suggest.

#Instructions for running the data:
To clone the directory in my codes, create a folder with the following path: "C:\Users\Computer\Documents\R data"
This is where the files should be downloaded to.

ENJOY!
